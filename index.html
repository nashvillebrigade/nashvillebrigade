<h3>        
<a name="who" class="anchor" href="#who"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who</h3>  
<p>The Nashville Civic Brigade provides citizens an opportunity to do what is most quintessentially Tennessean: roll up our sleeves, get involved and work together to improve our community. Data geeks, software developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and other volunteers partner to build new solutions using publicly-released data and code. We work in partnership with local government agencies and meet once a month to learn more about local civic hacking. </p>
<h3>        
<a name="what" class="anchor" href="#what"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What</h3>  
<p>The Nashville Civic Brigade was formed after local developers celebrated the <a href="hackforchange.org/â€Ž">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> sponsored by the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open">White House</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> on June 1st through 2nd, 2013. The <a href="http://hack4changenash.org/">local two-day hackathon</a> produced over half a dozen civic projects, some in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nashville.gov/Human-Relations-Commission.aspx">Nashville Metro Human Relations Commission</a>. With so much community interest and even more potential for the future, the Brigade went forward with the intention of cultivating stronger relationships with government partners, building the public and private infrastructure necessary to enable civic hacking projects to thrive, and providing support and fellowship for local civic hackers.</p>
<h3>        
<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h3>  
<p>Open data and application development are elements of the philosophy of open government which seeks to encourage transparency, accountability, and efficiency in our representative institutions. Civic hacking can support these values by giving citizens better access to information about their government, better communication with their representatives and other public servants, and improved services through the application of data-driven approaches to civic problems and opportunities. We live in an era of unprecedented technological change which has its own drawbacks and benefits. Civic hackers seek to make our government work in the best possible way for its citizens through technology.</p>
